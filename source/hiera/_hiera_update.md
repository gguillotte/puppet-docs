> ### **Note**: We've released a major update to Hiera called [Hiera 5](https://puppet.com/docs/puppet/latest/hiera.html).
>
> Hiera 5 is built into Puppet 4.9 and higher, and includes features like per-environment hierarchies, module data, simplified custom backends, improved debugging with `puppet lookup --explain`, and more.
>
> As part of this update, we've moved Hiera's documentation into the Puppet reference manual. Once you've upgraded to Puppet 4.9 or higher, see the following pages for more info about the new Hiera:
